                        Eat That Frog! by Brian Tracy is a powerful guide to personal productivity and time management. The book’s title is inspired by a quote attributed to Mark Twain: "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." Tracy uses this metaphor to emphasize the importance of tackling the most challenging tasks first. He provides 21 practical and actionable strategies to stop procrastinating and get more done in less time. With clear advice on goal-setting, prioritizing tasks, and focusing on high-impact activities, Eat That Frog! equips readers with the tools to overcome procrastination and achieve their most important goals.

The book emphasizes the importance of financial literacy, the value of investing in assets over liabilities, and the need for entrepreneurial thinking. By sharing lessons on money management, investing, and financial independence, Kiyosaki empowers readers to break free from the cycle of working for money and instead learn how to make money work for them.

                        The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson is a refreshingly honest and counterintuitive guide to living a good life.

By accepting the inherent struggles and choosing what to give a f*ck about, readers can find a more genuine and resilient path to satisfaction and success. The book is filled with practical advice, philosophical insights, and personal anecdotes that make it both engaging and thought-provoking.
